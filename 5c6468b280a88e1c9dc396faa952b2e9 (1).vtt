WEBVTT

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:16.850
A fellow hitman...?

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.480
The Silent Assassin!

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.360
Just my luck to end up competing
with a big shot for this job.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.490
However...

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.320
I'm not letting you have my target!

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:34.990
You and I both knew what we signed up
for when we got into this business!

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.150
Die!

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.510
<i>I'm sure I got in more attacks...</i>

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.930
<i>But I guess that doesn't</i>
<i>matter against this guy.</i>

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.890
<i>I swear... This is just my luck.</i>

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:06.790
Hey, hey, Tsukasa-kun!

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.210
We're going shopping and hitting up
a cafe after school! Wanna come?

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.760
Sorry, I need to stay
and finalize the club budgets.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.680
You're always busy. I guess that's
how it is for the student council.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.100
It's too bad.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.430
I'll join you next time.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.730
Thanks as always, Hosoyama.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.940
Shiori's always ready to help.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.520
I just can't stand letting things lie.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.270
What's wrong, Yuki?

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.690
Y'know those dumb jokes
Tsujimura-sensei slips in during English?

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.950
I dunno whether I'm supposed to laugh or what.

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.990
<i>That's</i> what's been on your mind?

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.620
You've got practice, right, Asahina-kun?

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.100
Yeah. I need to test out my new bamboo sword.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.090 line:20%
CHAPTER ONE: THE REAL HERO

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.170
Hey, I read that one too!

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.670
You like isekai stories?

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.630
I'm just going through
whatever I can read for free.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.760
Then lemme know if you've got recs.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.010
Free ones, of course!

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.060
Who's that guy Nanase-kun was talking to?

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.560
Oda Akira.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.350
Huh? Has he always been in our class?

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.690
He's never been one to make an impression.

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.940
<i>I was well aware of how</i>
<i>I faded into the background,</i>

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:17.160
<i>so someone talking to me in class</i>
<i>felt like a minor crisis.</i>

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.580
<i>However, that feeling would soon pass...</i>

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.120
<i>only to be replaced</i>
<i>by an actual, genuine crisis.</i>

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.240
Was that some kind of attack?

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.330
Where are we?

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.290
- Weren't we in the classroom?
- I'm so glad we're all alive.

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:04.580
Ladies and gentlemen!

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.580
His Royal Majesty would like a word with you.

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.580
Lend him your ears.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:14.880
Are they in costume?

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.720
What have you done to us?!

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.840
Quiet, please!

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:24.140
Welcome, and thank you for answering
our call from your faraway realm.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.270
This world is called Morrigan,

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.560
and you stand in the human kingdom of Retice,
the largest nation on the human continent.

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:31.940
"Human kingdom"?

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:35.860
We are currently under attack
from the demons.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.910
But only a hero from another world possesses
the power to defeat the Demon Lord.

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.200
Whoa, whoa. Are you serious?

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.950
ADVENTURERS, HEROES, OVERPOWERED SKILLS
- This is just like in my isekai stories!

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.540
Now then, we wish to identify
the hero among you.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.130
There will be but one.

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.720
Come place your hands on this crystal ball.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.180
Me, me! I'll do it!

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.850
If you say "Status" in your mind,
we shall see what your class is.

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:12.900
Huh? It's in Japanese?

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.900
DAISUKE WAKI, CLASS: ANIMAL TRAINER
- Aw, man! I'm not the hero?

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:21.160
Yet even your starting stats far exceed
that of an average person in this world.

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.620
You are sure to go down in legend
alongside the hero.

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:29.870 line:20%
YUKI UENO
CLASS: DISENCHANTER

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.290
"Disenchanter"?

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.840 line:20%
TOMOYA TSUDA
CLASS: KNIGHT

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.630 line:20%
SHIORI HOSOYAMA
CLASS: HEALER

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:43.430
I see!

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:44.510
Me next! Me!

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.010
If you say "Status" without
touching the crystal ball,

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.180
you can still see your own stats
for yourselves.

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:51.640
Status.

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:56.150
Says I'm a wind mage. What about you?

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:57.400
Assassin.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.900
Hey, that suits you to a T.

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:03.950
Honestly, it took me ages to realize
you were even in our class.

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:05.910
<i>What's going on here?</i>

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:07.080
SHIORI HOSOYAMA, CLASS: HEALER
<i>- What's with this disparity?</i>

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.580
AKIRA ODA, CLASS: ASSASSIN
<i>- What's with this disparity?</i>

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:13.790 line:20%
TSUKASA SATOU

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:15.210 line:20%
CLASS: HERO

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:17.210
As expected of the hero!

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:22.130
Normally, people only have around
500 attack power even at level cap.

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.800
But yours is nearly double that!

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:26.930
No surprise there.

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:31.680
He's smart, athletic, our student council
president, and popular to boot.

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:33.850
Those<i> are the hero's numbers?</i>

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:37.230
<i>So it's really only mine</i>
<i>that are this weirdly high...</i>

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:39.360
You wanna go next?

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.150
Not many of us left.

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:43.820
<i>This isn't good.</i>

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:47.240
<i>Are they even telling the truth</i>
<i>about the so-called Demon Lord?</i>

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:48.830
<i>I know nothing about this world.</i>

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:52.200
<i>Revealing my abnormal stats right now</i>
<i>could prove problematic.</i>

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:55.960
<i>But there's no worming out of this...</i>

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:59.250
CONCEAL PRESENCE
<i>- Maybe I'll try that.</i>

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:01.090
Conceal Presence.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.010
It'll be our turn soon...

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:08.300
H-Huh? Where'd he go?

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:15.940
Now that we know your classes,
we'll arrange for any equipment you need.

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:19.480
We've readied rooms as well,
so you may retire for the night.

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:23.820
<i>Phew, I managed to scrape through.</i>

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.420
<i>Are they monitoring us?</i>

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:44.460
<i>They must seriously be hiding something.</i>

00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:58.440
No one bothered to clean this room,

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:01.020
so I shouldn't have to worry
about anyone showing up.

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:02.610
Now then...

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:06.450
This looks like something
an assassin might wear.

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:08.610
Next up...

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:10.700
I need information.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.870
<i>Now that I get a look at the scenery,</i>

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:19.920
<i>we really are in another world, aren't we?</i>

00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:30.090
<i>What absurd athleticism.</i>

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:33.600
<i>I guess I got your stereotypical</i>
<i>summoning bonus.</i>

00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:36.730
<i>Conceal Presence.</i>

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:40.400
How's it going with the brats?

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:43.650
They are mere children
from a world without magic.

00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:45.360
They won't be a problem.

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:47.610
Excellent. Proceed as planned.

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:50.410
Remember, they are not
to enter the castle archives.

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:53.370
We can't have them learning too much.

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:54.990
As you wish.

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.300
<i>I don't know what it is you're after,</i>

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:08.130
<i>but I do know that you people</i>
<i>are up to no good.</i>

00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:14.550
<i>I could absolutely kill him,</i>
<i>right here and now.</i>

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:33.780
What a feast!

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:43.420
<i>Should I dismiss my concealment</i>
<i>and tell them what I saw last night?</i>

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:47.000
<i>But how could I get them to believe me?</i>

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:48.420
Hear me out, guys.

00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:52.220
We've all got to be on the same page.

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:55.720
We've apparently grown stronger
by coming to this world.

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:59.680
So shouldn't we use that power
to help the people here?

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:03.730
I want to go defeat the Demon Lord
like His Majesty asked.

00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:05.110
And I want your help!

00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:07.480
- Yeah, you're on!
- That's Tsukasa for you!

00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:11.360
<i>Damn, they're assuming the king</i>
<i>and the princess are our allies.</i>

00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:15.910
Attention, Squad 1!

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:19.200
Pleased to meet you.

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:21.100
My name is Saran Mithray.

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:26.130
I am knight commander of Retice.
Our "Last Bastion."

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:28.460
Though it's a bit pretentious
to say so myself, no?

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:29.670
Well, Gilles?

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:33.050
You're not exactly making a great
first impression here, Commander.

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:35.390
It's fine, it's fine.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:40.520
Now then, my little heroes,
today begins your training.

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:43.690
In one month's time, you'll enter
a dungeon to test your mettle.

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:48.110
That said, I doubt you have any experience.

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:50.360
Which is where we come in.

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:52.030
Thank you for training us!

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:54.150
Thank you!

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:55.950
What am I to do about this?

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:58.700
- For starters, I guess I need more intel.
- Squad 1, proceed to Tent D!

00:10:58.780 --> 00:10:59.990
- For starters, I guess I need more intel.
- Yessir!

00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:03.660
Gilles, you're in charge.

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:04.790
Huh?

00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:15.300
Is something the matter?

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:19.890
<i>I never dismissed Conceal Presence!</i>
<i>Does it have a max duration?</i>

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:23.270
Don't worry.
Your Conceal Presence is still active.

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:28.860
You see, my eyes happen to be
a little bit special.

00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:33.650
They're mystical, able to perceive
differences in temperature.

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:36.660
Then we have a problem.

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:41.950
I won't tell the king or princess,
so you can rest easy, my friend.

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:45.160
Wait, aren't you on their side?

00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:47.870
It's complicated.

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:51.420
Oh, but don't go telling the king that.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.170
Got it.

00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:58.640
You want to see the archives?

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:02.510
Yeah. I know nothing about this world.

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:04.680
Much less magic or skills.

00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:09.270
What level is your
Conceal Presence skill right now?

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:10.400
It's maxed out.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:11.570
Really?

00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:16.780
But most of my other skills are only level 1,
and I have no idea how to raise them.

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:19.490
If you'd like, I can teach you.

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:22.450
Plus, you won't find
what you seek in the archives.

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:25.910
<i>If I'm being honest,</i>
<i>I've been hyped this whole time.</i>

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:29.790 line:20%
<i>I'm in the kind of world</i>
<i>you only ever see in fiction.</i>

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:30.920
<i>But...</i>

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:36.510
I still have to find a way
to get back to my own world.

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:38.840
My family's waiting for me.

00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:43.890
Indeed, nothing beats a life
spent with family.

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:46.270
Do you know how I can return?

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:48.480
Unfortunately, I do not.

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:51.940
But you'll need to get stronger either way.

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:55.780
If you die before you get the chance
to go home, all will be for naught.

00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:59.900
At the very least, I can help you become
an excellent assassin.

00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:03.120
I don't like accepting favors for free.

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:07.870
Then you can pay me back
by telling me about your world.

00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:11.250
I'm itching for some novelty, in fact.

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:23.220
I haven't introduced myself.

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:25.060
I'm Oda Akira.

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:27.680
Nice to meet you, Akira.

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:37.530
Okay, so in addition to humans and demons,
this world also has elves and beastfolk.

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:41.150
That's right. We all live
on separate continents.

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:45.280
Hey, are you sure this is going
to help increase my skills?

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:46.450
But of course.

00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:49.710
You can only level your class
by killing monsters,

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:52.710
but you can level skills with training.

00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:56.590
Anyway, your world sounds fascinating.

00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:59.050
You speak of metal vessels that fly the sky

00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:02.760
and slates that instantly
transmit information worldwide.

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:05.180
To me, they're just ordinary things.

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.930
I'm starting to miss the ordinary, though.

00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:14.100
I'd say progress is satisfactory,

00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:19.150
but my workload is significant
because you're entirely focused on Akira.

00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:23.150
I mean, he's just so fun.
So are the stories of his world.

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:25.280
It's all most fascinating.

00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:26.320
This "Japan"?

00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:29.620
Indeed, the land the first hero hailed from.

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:32.710
What's more, the boy's
Conceal Presence skill is maxed out.

00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:33.960
Cameras can't capture him.

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:38.550
It's max level? But only the very
first hero ever achieved that!

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:42.220
Speak of the devil, I guess.

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:44.430
Then I shall take my leave.

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:50.140
I happen to crave new knowledge myself.

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:53.940
I've been sneaking into
the archives every night to read,

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:56.190
and I found this scary little book.

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.320
I suppose it would be quite scary.

00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:00.730
It contains plans for a coup.

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:05.570
I wrote it myself and disguised
it as a recipe book to hide it there.

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:10.700
I knew you would find it eventually.

00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:13.960
Our king is broken beyond repair.

00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:18.710
He's willing to pay a horrific price
to change the rules of our world.

00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:23.920
We cannot stand for it.

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:25.880
However...

00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:29.760
We knights owe a debt to the royal family.

00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:34.640
Reading it, I could tell you're after
a peaceful end to his reign.

00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:37.440
Perceptive as ever, Akira.

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:40.610
This would be easier if I'd killed him.

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:42.530
I have no ties to this world.

00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:49.370
I snuck into his study the very night
we were summoned to this world.

00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:53.410
He had no idea I was right behind him.

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:55.370
And yet...

00:15:56.290 --> 00:15:57.750
I couldn't do it.

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:01.090
You made the right choice.

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:02.130
Huh?

00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:05.380
The burden of killing a man
is a heavy one to bear.

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:11.510
You may be an assassin, but that doesn't
mean you're obligated to murder.

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:15.600
Spill no blood, especially if you're
to return to your world.

00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:21.940
You're right. My mother and little sister
would be disappointed if I came home a killer.

00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:28.030
Be an assassin who respects life
so that you may return to your family alive.

00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:29.910
There's no shame in that.

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:33.490
Why are you looking out for me so much?

00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:36.710
You didn't have to tell me
about the coup, either.

00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:39.210
It's because I expect much from you.

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:41.630
And I'm not just talking about your stats.

00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:44.880
Upon being summoned,
you didn't go with the flow.

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:47.720
You used your brain and decided
the best course of action.

00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:54.060
Only one who has endured much
and overcome it all is capable of that.

00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:01.270
I've lived in the background
since I was a kid.

00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:03.980
Nobody's ever taken notice of me.

00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:06.230
What are you talking about?

00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:10.200
I'm saying this is the first time
anyone's ever sung my praises.

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:12.450
In that case, in exchange,

00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:16.700
help me with my coup
before you return to your world.

00:17:16.790 --> 00:17:17.870
We'll keep it peaceful.

00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:20.160
I'll consider it.

00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:26.130
Your month is now up.

00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:28.720
Off to the Great Labyrinth of Kantinen we go.

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:30.800
You kids are heroes.

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:33.050
Walk with your heads held high.

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:38.520
<i>They came out in droves just</i>
<i>to see us off to the local dungeon?</i>

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:47.570
Why are you glaring at us?

00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:51.070
I'm just curious, is all.

00:17:51.610 --> 00:17:55.410
Everyone treats you
and your friends like heroes.

00:17:55.490 --> 00:17:58.870
But have you any idea what was
sacrificed to summon you here?

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:02.170
"Sacrificed"? Sorry, I'm afraid I don't.

00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:06.840
Then let us speak again once
you uncover the answer for yourself.

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:19.390
Something tells me this won't
be the last time we meet.

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:48.090
Another trap?!

00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:52.420
Should we fall back, Commander Saran?

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:55.510
Good idea. You've all done well
your first time out.

00:18:57.970 --> 00:19:01.520
O Lord, give me strength!

00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:05.310
Divine Sword!

00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:13.820
Now!

00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:21.620
More up here?

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:25.330
This is a smoke bomb to keep monsters at bay.

00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:28.590
Please use it should you ever
find yourself in peril.

00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:34.840
Okay, that should help!

00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:42.470
No way... What gives?

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:47.650
It can't be!

00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:49.560
A minotaur?!

00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:52.110
What's it doing on the upper floors?!

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:05.200
What?!

00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:14.380
Akira?

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:21.300
Don't push yourself. Your arms are broken.

00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:25.310
But if I don't protect our class, who will?

00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:28.350
And who's gonna protect <i>you</i>?!

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:29.690
Well...

00:20:30.150 --> 00:20:34.150
The hero's power is for saving the world!

00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:37.740
Then who's going to protect all of you?

00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:40.070
We can take care of ourselves!

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:43.830
Isn't that what we trained for?

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:48.500
But... I'm the hero...

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:49.670
The hero...

00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:53.590
<i>He's always been responsible,</i>
<i>but this is crazy.</i>

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.630
Do we have a disenchanter here?

00:20:56.050 --> 00:20:57.670
I'm a disenchanter...

00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:58.880
Cast Dispel on him.

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:00.760
'Kay.

00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:04.310
O baleful curse that plagues my friend...

00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:06.470
Begone from my presence!

00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:10.730
Holy crap! He really is cursed!

00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:11.860
Keep at it.

00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:16.320
Commander Saran!

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:17.690
Akira.

00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:20.450
I'm giving you-know-what a shot.

00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:22.320
You can't mean...

00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:25.330
All so I can survive.

00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:32.500
Understood. On my signal.

00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:38.550
O Lord,

00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:43.300
smite with your light these
foes that would obstruct us!

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:45.100
Lightning's Flash!

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:06.410
Shadow Magic... activate!
