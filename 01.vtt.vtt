01:37:32.853 --> 01:37:35.105

There's a legacy
that we honor

01:37:47.451 --> 01:37:49.870
When we bring
the light to the dark

01:37:49.953 --> 01:37:52.122
Whatever brings us together

01:37:52.206 --> 01:37:54.166
Can never tear us apart

01:37:54.249 --> 01:37:56.793
We become stronger than ever

01:37:56.877 --> 01:37:58.629
When we just trust

01:37:58.712 --> 01:38:01.381
Trust and believe it
You'll see that

01:38:01.465 --> 01:38:03.425
We’ll lead the way
When we just trust

01:38:03.509 --> 01:38:06.261
